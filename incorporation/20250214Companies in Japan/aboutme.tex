\subsection{Mission}
To navigate entrepreneurs, and  small and med-sized business with my professional skill and to bridge between foreign nationals and Japan business, wishing all of us keep growing to the future. 

%\subsection{Value}
%\subsubsection{Make Your Fixed Expense Minimized}
%On an early phase, your business might not be stable, and might not have enough revenue. Under such situation, if you had not small fixed expense, that could be a risk on your business.

%Accordingly, I believe that it would be good for you to start your business with small initial investment, that also could make your fixed expense small.

%I could suggest you to use cloud-based services, that could make you expense less than hiring an administrative employee. Besides, my services could help your administration work, like keeping your accounting book and filing some applications to the tax office.

%\subsubsection{Tax Scheme}
%\paragraph{Tax Rate}
%If you  had not spent many days on your business, your busness form on tax would be a solo-proprietor, that is a self-employed. Then, you are subject to individual income tax in Japan. If you had your company like K.K., you have to file a tax return on corporate income tax.

%The tax rate is different between individuals and companies. Therefore, if your income as a solo-proprietor is large enough, it would be better for your business to be run by a company.

%\paragraph{Consumption Tax}
%When you have more than JPY 10 million taxable revenue, you are taxed after 2 years. Consumption tax obligation is determined by this JPY 10 million taxable revenue rule. This is also applied to the company that has capital amount less than JPY 10 million.
