\section{Who can be an incorporator}

\begin{coloritemize}
\item Foreign nationals Can Also Be incorporators
\item Foreign Companies Can Also Be incorporators
\end{coloritemize}

An incorporator is an individual or entity responsible for planning the establishment of a company and carrying out the necessary incorporation procedures. Many documents required for company formation must include the incorporator's seal or, alternatively a signature.

Under this method of incorporation, the incorporator becomes the owner of the company once it is established. In the case of a KK, the incorporator assumes the role of a shareholder.

If you intend to establish a subsidiary, the parent company must act as the incorporator. Alternatively, an individual incorporator can first establish the company and then transfer all shares (equity) to the intended parent company.

Regardless of the method chosen, the incorporator plays a crucial role in the incorporation process. Therefore, I request that you provide accurate information about the incorporator.

\subsection{Foreign nationals Can Also Be incorporators}
A foreign national residing in Japan can serve as a incorporator and obtain a Japanese seal certificate, as they are legally recognized as a resident. This seal certificate allows them to complete the company establishment procedures.

If a foreign national living overseas (or a Japanese citizen residing abroad) wishes to become an incorporator, a signature certificate is required since a Japanese seal certificate cannot be issued. 

However, as long as a valid signature certificate is provided, the individual can act as a incorporator and establish a company, regardless of nationality.

\subsection{Foreign Companies Can Also Be incorporators}
Both individuals and companies can act as incorporators. A foreign company, defined as a company incorporated and registered outside Japan under the laws of its respective country, can also serve as a incorporator in Japan.

If a foreign company already has a commercial registration in Japan, it can proceed with incorporation procedures in the same manner as a Japanese company.

Even if a foreign company does not have a commercial registration in Japan, it can still act as an incorporator and establish a company. In this case, a certificate of registration from its country of incorporation and a signature certificate from its legal representative are required.

\section{Who Can be Representative Directors and Directors}

\begin{coloritemize}
\item What should be a company organization
\item Foreign nationals can be Representative Directors\/Directors
\item Affects opening of bank accounts
\end{coloritemize}

A GK must have at least one managing member to be formed. A legal entity can serve as a managing member, but if it does, it must designate an individual to carry out the associated duties.
At least one member, whether an individual or a legal entity, must be a representative member.

A KK must have at least one director and one of directors msut be a representative director.
Additionally, a KK can have a board of directors with at least two directors, a board of corporate auditors with at least two corporate auditors, and an accounting auditor.

\subsection{What should be a company organization}

During the start-up period, it is advisable to have a simple structure with managing members\/directors, including at least one representative member\/director, to minimize costs and enable quick decision-making for efficient management.

\subsection{Foreign nationals can be Representative Directors\/Directors}

Non-residents can serve as both a GK's managing partner and a KK's director. They do not need to be Japanese nationals.  

However, if a non-resident or non-Japanese national wishes to become an operating partner of a GK or a director of a KK, the incorporation process requires more complex documentation compared to that for a Japanese resident. (For details, see Company Formation Service.)

\subsection{Affects opening of bank accounts}

There is no issue if the representative or director of the company being established is a foreign national. However, if they are a non-resident without a Japanese address, they may face difficulties when applying to open a bank account.

If all of the company's directors are non-residents without a Japanese address, an account administrator with a Japanese address will be required.

If you need a Japanese resident to serve as a director of a KK or a managing member of a GK, you can appoint a nominee director. (For details, see Nominee Director Service.)
